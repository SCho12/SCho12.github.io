    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Spencer Cho and I am a graduate Computer Science student. I have been here at Texas A&M University since 2019 and am expecting to graduate with my master's degree in 2025. I've always had a passion for programming since high school and am very excited to see what the future holds. I mainly program in C++ and Python, but have dabbled in other languages before such as Java and Haskell. I prefer being a full stack developer so that I can be more well rounded and have worked on various projects in either a frontend or backend role.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Even though I enjoy to program, it isn't all that I do. In my free time I have a lot of hobbies such as: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Video Editing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Pursuits</h2>
    <div class="flex-container">

    </div>
    <p>Although I have graduated, I always look for ways to get better at what I do. In the pursuit of this, I have begun to look into competitive programming to improve my logic and problem solving skills. I primarily use <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> to help me tackle various problems and study the solutions whenever I get stumped.</p>

    <h2>Interests in Accessiblity</h2>
    <p>When it comes to my interests in accessibility, I find myself to be drawn towards screen readers as well as braille displays. However, in regards towards increasing the accessibility in computing, I support any and all advancements towards this.</p>
